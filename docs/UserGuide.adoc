This product is not meant for end-users and therefore there is no user-friendly installer.
Please refer to the <<DeveloperGuide#setting-up, Setting up>> section to learn how to set up the project.

== Starting the program

*Using IntelliJ*

. Find the project in the `Project Explorer` (usually located at the left side)
.. If the `Project Explorer` is not visible, press kbd:[ALT+1] for Windows/Linux, kbd:[CMD+1] for macOS to open the `Project Explorer` tab
. Go to the `src` folder and locate the `Main` file
. Right click the file and select `Run Main.main()`
. The program now should run on the `Console` (usually located at the bottom side)
. Now you can interact with the program through the `Console`

*Using Command Line*

. 'Build' the project using IntelliJ
. Open the `Terminal`/`Command Prompt`
. `cd` into the project's `out\production\addressbook-level2` directory
. Type `java seedu.addressbook.Main`, then Enter to execute
. Now you can interact with the program through the CLI

== Changes from level 1

What's different from AddressBook-Level1:

* Support for storing address (`a/`) and tags (`t/`)
* Support for marking a contact detail as 'private' (`pa/`) (`pe/`) (`pp/`)
* View details of a person (`view` : shows non-private details), (`viewall` : shows all details)

== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

[TIP]
====
Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`
====

== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book. +
Format: `add NAME [p]p/PHONE_NUMBER [p]e/EMAIL [p]a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters, items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional,
items with `...` after them can have multiple instances. Order of parameters are fixed.

Put a `p` before the phone / email / address prefixes to mark it as `private`. `private` details can only
be seen using the `viewall` command.

Persons can have any number of tags (including 0).
****

Examples:

* `add John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
